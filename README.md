# Chippy8

This is a really basic CHIP-8 emulator made in C++. Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language that was developed by Joseph Weisbecker in the 1970s. It was designed to make it easier to program video games for 8-bit microcomputers, such as the COSMAC VIP and the Telmac 1800. Chip-8 programs run on a virtual machine that simulates the hardware of these computers.

As of right now, emulator doesn't support audio.


## Usage

```bash
.\Chappy8.exe <path_to_rom_file>
```

* Tobias V. Langhoff and Austin Morlan for their great guides on making CHIP-8 emulators.
* @sarbajitsaha for making his CHIP-8 emulator. It was a really good reference for me, I looked at his code whenever I couldn't figure out how to implement something.
